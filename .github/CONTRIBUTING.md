## Issues & Bugs

We use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/mirajago/pande_me/issues) to track public bugs and issues. Report a bug or problem by opening a new issue; it's that easy! Please contact any organzier on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/en-US/Hannover-Mobile-Development-Meetup/) if you found a security issue that shouldn't be discussed in public.

Great bug reports tend to have:

* A quick summary and/or background
* Specific steps to reproduce
* Give sample code or include a screenshot/.gif if you can
* Tell what you expected would happen
* Tell What actually happens
* Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Translations
